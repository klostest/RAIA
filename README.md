# RAIA (repeat aerial imagery analysis)

### Matlab code for visualization and phenology analysis of repeat aerial photography
This respository is designed for analysis of my aerial imagery of Harvard Forest, available [here](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu:8080/exist/apps/datasets/showData.html?id=hf294). There is functionality to link with my preprocessed version of the Harvard Forest [species map](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu:8080/exist/apps/datasets/showData.html?id=hf253), which is available here in the 'metadata' directory. My published work based on this code is referenced below. Please cite the data sets or references accordingly.

- display_species_map: interactive plot of aerial image and tree stem locations, allowing identification of species and stem tag number

- species_color_guide: plot of legend with species color codes
